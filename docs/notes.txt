Graph features:
- undirected	
- unweighted	
- connected	
- simple (aka no loops or multiple edges between nodes)
- finite

- bipartite graph
  - rule 1: have two disjoint and independent sets (parts) with vertices
  - rule 2: each edge connects two vertices from two sets (parts)
  - eq: does not contain odd length cycles
  - interest only in connected graphs => only one partition
  special labels:
  - balanced: cardinality of those two sets is the same
  - biregular: each vertex have the same degree
  conventions:
  - labels for parts: U, V 
  - label for graph: G = (U, V, E)

- cubic graph
  - all vertecies have degree three (3-regular graph)
  - number of vertecies need to be even (from handshaking lemma)
  \sum_{v \in V} deg(V) = 2 |E|
  - number of edges is 3n/2 


Subpath count details:
- count trivial paths (single-vertex paths)
- simple paths only (aka paths cannot repeat vertices more then once)

3 subcategories of graphs:
- also known as three-regular graph
- cubic graphs: every vertex has degree of 3 (3 edges for each node)
- n nodes implies 3/2 * \cdot edges
- constrains:
  - simple cubic have
